# Timelapse-UI
This is a fun project I had in order to play around with Fast API, Jinja templates and some JavaScript.

## What does it do?
It fetches data from an API, shows it in a list and lets you play timelapses that are generated from road-side webcams all over Norway. Please note that the data is not maintained nor served by me, hence the API is not exposed in the repo.
You can also speed up the timelapses using the speed multiplier.

## Will it be maintained? 
Maybe. Depends if I get more nice ideas to put in, but for now, this is the final result. PS: The homepage is not even made...
